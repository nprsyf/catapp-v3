# CatApp
 <hr>

## Introduction:
This application serves as a basic interview template for SwiftUI based interviews, allowing interviewees to build upon a basic framework provided and implement additional features.
 <hr>
 
## Purpose:
The purpose of the CatApp is to provide a starting template for interviewees. The end goal is to produce a UI that comes as close as possible to finalProduct.png. The interviewer will be responsible for walking the candidate through the app's existing functionality and what is the expected outcome of the exercise.
